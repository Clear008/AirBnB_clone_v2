<h1 align="center">HBNB - The Console</h1>

This repository contains a project to build a clone of the AirBnB website, integrating file and database (MySQL) storage in a back-end API with front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB. This stage implements a backend interface, or console, to manage program data. Console commands allow the user to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions.
